Choosing the right treatment is more difficult with the thousands of products and remedies available on the market. Product reviews for under eye circle treatments only add to the confusion because they seem to lack consensus.\nThey key to finding a dark under eye circle remedy is correctly identifying the reasons behind them. Then, choosing the most appropriate treatment or remedies. In this guide, you’re going to learn everything there is to learn about getting rid of dark under eye circles.\nWhat causes dark circles under eyes?\nDark undereye circles are caused by a number of factors. The main causes of under eye circles are:\n -Genetics -Lack of sleep -Facial structure -Lifestyle - drinking, smoking, sun -Poor makeup -Thin skin -Aging -Dehydration -Allergies  We will discuss each of these causes and what can be done to minimise dark circles resulting from each one.\nGenetic Dark Circles\n Genetic dark circles and or under eye bags are a result of hereditary darker pigmentation inherited from your parents. Sometimes we inherit our parents good traits, and sometimes, their less favourable ones. This is no different than the curly (or straight) hair or freckles you inheritedTake the good with not so good and simply find a way to deal.\nStress not, hereditary circles around the eyes are manageable. Mainly, it’s about lightening the pigmentation, protecting the area from the sun and where possible, preventing future pigmentation. Finally, a good light reflecting and tone correcting concealer takes care of anything left behind.\nGetting rid of under eye bags is a bit more tricky. Eye creams and serums can depuff to a certain extent. Caffeine is a great ingredient for deflating eye bags. Lymph drainage massages can help as well. However, if the bags are part of the shape of your eyes, creams will do little to help. Makeup will be your best bet with surgical treatments being a more drastic alternative. Various options are available, depending on how bad the bags under your eyes are and how far you want to go to address them.\n The best remedies for genetic dark eye circles are eye creams that contain a slight lightening agent along with a sunscreen. We like Kiehl\u0026rsquo;s Anti-Wrinkle Age Defender Eye Repair. Even though it’s marked as a men’s product, we found that it lightened our under eye circles and even refined the little lines that were starting to form.\nFor an alternative choice, we loved Mroobest Skin Lightening Cream . It’s intended for underarms, intimate areas, knees, etc., so we took a risk trying it on our hereditary dark circles and found that it lightened the skin under the eyes the same as it would on other parts of the body. We did a series of patch tests, first on our arm, then that test came out ok, we did a patch our faces. Finally, when we were happy that there was no adverse reaction, we tried a small patch test under the eyes. When this worked beautifully without an adverse reaction, we applied to the rest of our undereye area.\nFor those who have a larger budget, we love iS Clinical white lightening serum. Developed by a team of world-renowned pharmacologist, this treatment is backed by serious scientific research. It contains a brightening mushroom extract and alpha-arbutin. Long-term, this serum actually helps skin to produce less melanin, which prevents the problem of discolouration in the future. Again, we strongly recommend doing the same gradual patch tests, starting with your arm.\nGenetic eye bag treatments\n The best remedies for genetic eye bags are treatments that contain caffeine or arnica. Caffeine is pretty self explanatory stimulant while arnica was more of a mystery to us. We first heard about this wonder ingredient when it was recommended as a treatment for severe swelling after one of our editors had a rather serious fall. Arnica did wonders for fist sized lumps. So it made sense that arnica would work for under eye swelling.\nOur favourite under eye bags creams include:\nTata Harper Restorative Eye Cream The treatment works by stimulating the activity of white blood cells to relieve congestion, thereby reducing under-eye bags. A bonus is that when the congestion dissipates, some of the red blood cells pooled beneath thin under-eye skin, dark circles can disappear as well. So this option is also great for those suffering from dark under eye circles.\nJurlique Herbal Recovery Eye Gel, Arnica works hard to deflate while a slew of soothing ingredients like eyebright (anti-inflammatory), heartease (promotes drainage) and evening primrose oil calm remaining puffiness.\nIn Lab Medical Caviar and Biophytonic eye serum contains both caffeine and arnica. This brand from Spain is known for highly innovative products backed by 20 years of research in biotechnology. The line is based on epigenetics, last generation products, with treatments for medical grade use and personal use,\nLack of sleep: \nDark undereye circles can also result from a lack of sleep, or lack of proper sleep. Our analysis concludes three main reasons for lack of quality and/or quantity of sleep.\n 1) Late nights/early mornings 2) Insomnia 3) Poor quality of sleep  Late nites and early mornings quickly take a toll on your under eye circles. At best, you’ll see a mild darkening. At worst, you’ll look like last night’s cocktails turned into a brawl. Fear not, aside from telling you to catch more zzz’s, we have some temporary solutions. We stress temporary because we would never advise you to neglect sleep. In our late night/early morning hay day, we stuck to a strict schedule of 3 max late nights per week in a row and a heavy dose of concealer.\nInsomnia. Nearly one out of three people suffer from insomnia. Little sleep means dark under eye circles for many sufferers. While concealer and creams can help, the eyes will still look tired and the tiredness will seep through even the best camouflage. Therefore, it’s best to deal with the root of the insomnia.\nInsomnia tends to be mostly in the mind and sometimes in the body. It’s about getting the mind to stand still, or at the very least, slow down enough to sleep. For mind related insomnia, we recommend a sleeping aid app like Pzizz. Loved by Steve Jobs and our humble editors team, Pzizz has a free version that should be enough to get you started and paid version if you need a bit more zzz’s. Meditation also quieted all the rattling in our minds. In fact, meditation is clinically proven to improve sleep, reduce anxiety and improve focus. We like Calm because it’s main aim is to assist people in calming down. When we don’t feel like listening to an app, we simply focus our mind away from the rattling thoughts. For example, naming an animal or a country for every letter of the alphabet.\nBody related insomnia can be abated with progressive muscle relaxation techniques. Click here for WebMD’s guide to progressive muscle relaxation.\nPoor quality of sleep\nDo you still have under eye circles and eye bags even though you’re getting a proper night’s sleep? The answer could be in the quality of your sleep!\n We recommend tracking your sleep with a device like the FitBit. Your FitBit can show how much sleep you get overall and what percentage of your sleep you spend in the various sleep cycles such as REM, light and deep sleep. Deep sleep is responsible for body recovery should comprise about 20% of your total sleep time. So if you’re spending significantly less time in deep sleep, your dark circles and under eye puffiness is likely to be worse.\nYou are also likely to be awake and restless during the night without being aware of it. FitBit also tracks this information for you. Fitbit also gives your a nightly sleep score that assess how well you slept overall. We like the Fitbit Inspire HR for its comprehensive information and ease of use.\nOne of our editors found that although she was average eight hours of sleep per night, she still woke up feeling tired and the dark circles under her eyes made her look even more tired. Her Fitbit sleep logs confirmed that her sleep quality was very poor. She woke up many times during the night and spent most of her sleeping time in REM or light sleep. Her deep sleep, which is needed for body recovery, averaged at 8% compared to the recommended 20%.\n She invested in a pair of earplugs to drown out the city noise. We recommend soft “tree shaped” silicone ear plugs as opposed to foam because they tend to stay in better. Snipping off a bit of the ends might help with them poking into your ears. A highly opaque eye mask can help keep out light.\nIf you’re worried about missing the alarm, fear not! FitBit has a silent vibrating alarm.\nIt also helps if you can stick to a sleep schedule and avoid eating several hours before bed.\nFacial structure \nFacial structure can impact under eye circles and eye bags. Deep set eyes, hooded eyes, large lower lids and even a prominent nose can impact the appearance of circles around eyes. These facial structures can cast shadows on your face, which either create the appearance of or worsen dark eye circles.\nStrategic application of makeup can help get rid of under eye circles from facial structures. The key is to lighten the areas where shadows fall and/or to draw attention away from areas. Most makeup counters offer fees ranging from £30-£60 that are redeemable towards purchase of products. Some offer complimentary makeover. Please see our cosmetics makeover guide.\nLifestyle\n Under eye circles and bags can form as a result of lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking a lot of alcohol, computer/tv eyestrain, overexposure to the sun and your diet. We will explore reducing the appearance of eye circles and bags resulting from these factors.\nSmoking reduces your body’s stores of vitamin C, which is the vitamin responsible for creating healthy collagen in your skin. While quitting smoking is an obvious choice, reducing your nicotine intake as much as possible might be an easier compromise in the interim.\nAlcohol contributes to dehydration, and dehydration may lead to dark circles and bags under your eyes. One of our editors has a strict policy of drinking two glasses of water for every alcoholic drink and looks reasonably refreshed after big nights out. This remedy is of course applicable only not a replacement for moderating alcohol intake.\nDark undereye circles can appear from dietary factors such as iron deficiencies and eating a lot of salty foods. A low level of iron in your blood can lead hemoglobin to breakdown more easily which causes the thin skin below the eyes to appear darker. Salt makes your body retain more fluid and can make you more puffy overall, including the areas under and around your eyes. An ideal amount of salt is no more than 1,500 mg of salt per day. Therefore, you can get rid of dark circles and under eye bags by simply adjusting your diet.\nScreentime\n Dark eye circles can form if you spend a large portion of your day staring at a computer screen or television. The strain can cause blood vessels around your eyes to enlarge and the surrounding skin to appeal more transparent. Consequently, the area under your eyes will appear darker.\nIf possible, try to reduce your screen and television time. Alternatively, try a monitor eye protector to deduce the glare and strain. Also try stepping away from the screen for a few minutes. Fitbit Inspire HR can send you reminders once per hour to step away and then show your progress over time.\nPoor makeup\n Dark eye circles can form as a result of makeup.\nBecause mascaras and eyeliners are so pigmented, many cleansers fail to remove them in their entirety. We found that Ahava\u0026rsquo;s eye makeup remover removed absolutely everything, including waterproof mascara. Yet, it was very gentle and did not feel drying.\nCircles around the eyes can be created by runny eye makeup. Patch test your cosmetics on your hand before you purchase them. Draw a few lines with your mascara, eye liner etc., on the back of your hand. If they haven’t smudged for 4 hours or longer, you have a winner. If you use primer or eye cream underneath, make sure that they dry completely before applying eye makeup. You can put them on before your patch test for a “fool proof” methodology.\nUnder eye circles can also appear worse if you’re using the wrong colour of concealer and foundation (if you wear it). Always test the colour of your makeup by looking at outdoors, indoors, in fluorescent lighting and in the evening. Further, choose a concealer colour that most closely matches the light parts of your complexion. Do not choose a shade that is lighter than your skin tone. It will look unnatural and will create a disbalance in the rest of your face. Please see our full guide for choosing a concealer.\nThin Skin\n Thin under eye skin makes dark circles look worse. Unfortunately the thinness of the skin under your eyes is based primarily on aging and genetics genetics. With age, collagen breakdown exceeds collagen production resulting in a thinner epidermis. Your dermis gives support and thickness to your skin, so when it thins, skin becomes more transparent, crinkly and fine lines become visible. Sun damage can make it worse because it weakens skin.\nStaying hydrated and products such as vitamin C or retinoids can help improve the look of dark circles. Our top pick in this category is FAB Skin Lab Retinol Eye Cream with Triple Hyaluronic Acid. It delivers hydration, caffeine and retinol to improve the appearance of under eye circles. On top of that, it has a reflective lightly tinted pigment to deliver instant results. Don’t forget to dab your favourite sunscreen in there as well.\nDehydration \nUnder eye circles can look more prominent if you’re dehydrated. Because the skin around your eyes is very close to the underlying bone, a lack of fluids can cause blood vessels to become more prominent. We recommend putting in a mechanism for drinking the recommended 8 glasses with 8 ounces of water. Either fill a large water bottle first thing in the morning and drink throughout the day, or use your Fitbit Inspire HR hourly reminders to move around and drink a bit of water. Alternatively, we recommend a serum with a high concentration of hyaluronic acid such as L\u0026rsquo;Oréal Revitalift Filler Renew Hyaluronic Acid Eye Cream.\nAllergies \nDark circles and under eye bags can result from allergies to pollen, dust, and pet dander. People with hayfever may notice them at the height of the season. Food allergies and allergies to various cosmetics ingredients can also contribute to dark circles.\nIt’s important to identify the cause(s) of your allergies and treat them accordingly. Antihistamines might be appropriate for pollen and dander. An air purifier and keeping your home extra clean might help. When it comes to cosmetics, again, identifying the culprit ingredients is key. We also recommend choosing cosmetics lines that specifically offer hypoallergenic product like Clinique.\nMedical treatments\nWe prefer addressing dark circles without medical treatments. However, if you’ve exhausted all options and would like to take your treatments to the next level, we recommend starting a conversation with your doctor. Some of the option they could recommend are:\nlaser surgery to resurface the skin and enhance skin tightening medical tattoos to inject pigment into thinning skin areas tissue fillers to conceal blood vessels and melanin that are causing skin discoloration beneath your eyes. fat removal to remove excess fat and skin, revealing a smoother and more even surface surgical implants of fat or synthetic products Invasive medical treatments can be expensive, painful, and often require a long recovery time.\nConclusion\nYou should now have a clear understanding of what causes your dark eye circles and bags and how to get rid of (or lessen) them.\nWe love to hear your feedback.

In this guide, you are going to learn how to exfoliate the body like a pro.\nWe show you how to use a coffee scrub, sugar scrub, sea salt scrub and other types of body scrubs. We also share secrets used by high end spas that you can easily replicate at home. “OMG! Is that human skin?” is a typical reaction after following our process.\nThe key to understanding how to use an exfoliating body scrub effectively is choosing the body scrub that is most appropriate for your needs. Before using a body scrub at home, it is imperative to prepare your skin appropriately. You must also apply a body scrub in a way that won’t damage your skin or cause adverse results. We cover all of this information and show you a quick method and a longer one.\nHow to apply a body scrub [Luxury Spa Tips At Home]\n The key to using body scrub is preparing your skin. The main idea is to soften the surface of your skin so that the body scrub can achieve maximum sloughing of dead skin cells. Preparation can be done in a number of ways and depends on the amount of time you have and how much you want to fuss with it. We will give you a couple of options.\n   Option 1 - How to apply a body scrub when you have more time and want a spa experience at home\nThis option should take around 30 minutes, but you can also adjust the time to suit your needs.\n Ideally, you would be able to steam your skin at a sauna. However, a sauna can be easily replicated at home by running the shower on a hot setting for about 5 minutes. Always point the hot water away from yourself. Depending on the size of your bathroom, it should start to fill up with steam fairly quickly. If you have a cabin shower, you can step inside and put the water on as hot as you can without burning yourself. Again, direct the water away from yourself and be very careful to avoid burns. Your skin should not get wet. It’s about steaming. Make sure the ventilation is off and that the main door and windows are shut. If at any time you start to feel dizzy or unwell, immediately open the main door, windows, etc. to let the steam out. Always keep a bottle of cold water nearby and sip it while the steam is coming and during the steaming process.\nOnce there is steam, sit there for a few minutes or until you feel the typical “I’ve had enough sauna” effect. Then, step into the bath/shower if you’ve been sitting outside of it. Rub Moroccan black soap all over your body. Moroccan black soap has been used for centuries to help remove dead skin cells, dirt, and pollution build up while keeping skin smooth and supple. We love Beldi Soap from Kahina Giving Beautybecause of the intoxicating Neroli scent that\u0026rsquo;s reminiscent of jasmine. It softens like no other and best of all, a portion of the profits go towards supporting programs that improve the lives of Berber women. This feels like a true luxury treat and you feel doubly good because you’ve helped someone else.\nRinse the Moroccan soap and dry your body. Step back into the shower and apply a body mask. (You can also skip to the next step if you prefer to save a bit of time.) We love 417 Body Wrap Dead Sea Catharsis Mask because our skin felt ultra smooth after using it. The brand also says that it helps with cellulite with longer term use. We definitely saw an improvement in the dimples on our thighs after using it once, but we cannot say whether this was as a result of the whole ritual or just the 417 body mask.\nFinally, follow all steps from Option 2 (below). By the time you finish, you will feel like an absolute goddess!\nOption 2: How to apply a body scrub when you have a few minutes\nThis option is really the bare minimum that should be done for body scrub application. It should take 5-10 minutes.\n While standing in the shower/bath and BEFORE you turn on the water, run shower oil all over your skin. It is absolutely imperative that you do this before you get your skin wet because the oil will stick to your skin better and will have a fantastic softening effect. Spread the oil generously and be sure to cover every part that you want exfoliated, especially tougher areas like your elbows and palms. If you are also exfoliating your feet, it is advisable to use a shower stool or to sit on the floor of your shower/bathtub. Be very careful not to slip - oil is slippery. It\u0026rsquo;s best to use a shower oil (as opposed to a beauty oil) because they will rinse much easier when it’s time to wash everything off. We love Rituals Rose and Almond Oil.. The scent is absolutely divine and our skin was softer than ever before. It also has the right balance of slipperiness and sticks to your skin well enough for the next step.\nTake a small scoop of your body scrub into your hand and start spreading it, focusing on one area at a time such as an arm, leg, stomach, back etc. Massage it in small circular motions upwards. Avoid pulling on your skin and avoid large movements - in the long run unnecessary tugging will only exacerbate wrinkles and sagging. We love Rituals Rose and Almond Oil scrub because it has the perfect consistency and texture to give us baby soft skin.\nOnce you finished an area, move on to the next. Don’t forget your hands and palms. Also, be sure to cover the underside of your arms - most people tend to neglect this area!\nFinally, rinse it while helping it along with a soapy loofah. After you dry with a towel, if you have time, follow with a skin softening oil such as Avene Body Oil. We like this oil because it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin super soft. However, it’s worth noting that it should only be used on the body and won’t double as a facial or hair oil.\nMaking your body scrub last longer\nNow that you know how to use your body scrub properly, we’d like to show you how to make the results last longer. The key here depends on the season and type of climate you live in. If it’s cold/dry - moisturisers are your best bet. However, we recommend avoiding overly heavy ones because they will clog your pores, cause breakouts and unsightly bumps.\nWarmer weather calls for light moisturisers and a deeper cleansing body wash that will de-gunk your pores after sweat.\nHumidity is your friend when it comes to keeping your skin supply and making the effects of your body scrub last. The only downside of it is that smog and gunk tends to stick to your skin. Fear not! We recommend dry brushing (putting a bit of body oil on the brush beforehand makes magic!) or using a good loofah.\nHeading 2: What’s the best body scrub?\n The best body scrub is the one that is most appropriate for your skin type. The grain size of the body scrub should parallel your skin. The finer and more delicate your skin, the finer and more delicate the body scrub. Do a patch test before purchasing and if the body scrub feels painful, like it’s pulling at your skin or leaves a lasting redness, do not buy it. Using a scrub that is too coarse can lead to micro scarring and make your skin rougher in the long term. It is better to use as fine of a grain as possible, yet still effective on your skin. It should feel like a tiny, pleasant massage. (Later in this guide we show you the trick spa’s use to get the most out of these tiny grains. Please keep reading.)\nBe sure to look at the consistency of the body scrub. A body scrub consists of a liquid part and the scrub particles. The liquid serves as an adhesive, skin lubricant and carrier for the scrub particles. You need some liquid, but you don’t want too much because it won’t be effective. You’re looking for a high density of scrub particles.\nBody scrub ingredients such as coffee, sugar, salt or another type of scrub should correspond to your needs. Coffee has been shown to help cellulite. Sea salt can have a lot of helpful minerals. Both are said to have de-puffing properties. Sugar, we are less fond of because of it’s aging properties. Also, be sure to check the other ingredient in the body scrubs to make sure that it doesn’t contain ingredients you wish to avoid or known allergens.\nConclusion\nWe hope this post showed you how to use a body scrub effectively. Our aim is to share decades of skin care obsession with you. We don’t want to post a bunch of Photo-shopped before/after photos and make you believe that we recommend miraculous cures. We do want to share with you logic and reasons for why what we recommend works.\nDo you have other skin care questions? Please let us know by commenting below!

So I politely explained that I was actually bare faced. \u0026ldquo;What? Not even foundation?\u0026rdquo; I was very puzzled and quietly shook my head.\nAt that time, I was in my mid 20\u0026rsquo;s and didn\u0026rsquo;t really think about having pretty skin. I just took care of mine as a habit I picked up along the way. Somehow, I got a pleasure out of doing little rituals and solving the problems my skin, hormones, stress, etc., threw at me. It was like a little puzzle. I\u0026rsquo;m very curious and highly analytical by nature - so I treated my skin with the same \u0026ldquo;Ms. Fix It\u0026rdquo; mentality that applied to any issue I encountered.\nFlash forward, and as I\u0026rsquo;ve aged, I noticed more and more people complimenting my skin. I get told that I look younger than friends who are younger than I am. Some might say it\u0026rsquo;s genetics and lifestyle. It\u0026rsquo;s true that these help, but I\u0026rsquo;m no saint and I was not born to skin models. I smoked for years and both of my parents have their share of skincare woes.\nI still thought people were just being nice until very recently, when I helped one such younger friend implement a skincare routine, get rid of a couple long standing blemishes and get a nice glow. It happened when went shopping for skin care products together and she insisted that certain products were the best things since sliced bread. Some of them were. Just not for her skin and not for the problems she was trying to solve. It also dawned on me that her methods of application and certain habits may have actually negated the benefits of some of the very expensive products she touted.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy to persuade someone who had been loyal to her skin care ways for such a long time, but I did manage to convince her to add a particular glycolic peel and a Korean Essense to her routine. They worked! So she went back to the shop, got the face wash I recommended and stopped mixing her night time moisturiser with her serum before application like I told her to. Lo and behold, her skin glowed!\n\u0026ldquo;You should write this stuff down somewhere\u0026rdquo; she said. And that\u0026rsquo;s how this blog began.\nMy aim is to share skincare insights based on decades of skin care obsession. I don’t post a bunch of Photoshopped before/after photos to make you believe that I found miraculous cures. I do share with you logic and reasons for why what I recommend works.\nGood skin is one of the most beautiful and attractive things you can wear. It can mean needing to wear less makeup and/or feeling more confident on the day you go completely makeup free. Good skin can make an old ratty T-shirt look amazing because of the smooth glowing shoulder peeking out from underneath it. It can mean being mistaken for a goddess!\nDo you have other skin care questions?\nPlease let us know by commenting below! I’ll do my best to create a post to answer your questions.\nI often write with a group of friends - women of 20, 30 and 40 something range. We are of varied skin types, beauty budget and time available for self care. However, we all fundamentally believe that taking care of our skin is by far, the most important part of beauty.\n","permalink":"https://lucylucy83.github.io/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":["Face"],"contents":"A simple skincare routine will help tune up your complexion and also troubleshoot any areas you want to work on. A simple skincare routine will help you stick to your skincare goals and is exactly what you want because you will need time to see the effects of your efforts. Consistency is key and you need around 6 weeks to see a full impact. However, your skin should start showing positive signs after 2 weeks.\nTherefore, while it may be tempting and commendable to set an extensive overhaul of your skin care habits, we recommend that you start with a simple skincare routine. Also, to reduce the number of things your have to do in your routine, try to stick with multi-functioning products. For example: a moisturiser with sunscreen and a tint, etc.\nA basic face care routine starts with cleansing\nIf you do nothing else, cleanse. Even the most simple skincare routin must start with a cleanser and a bit of water. Cleansing wipes DO NOT replace this step as they still leave traces make up and grime on your skin.\n It is absolutely imperative that you remove all makeup and grime from the day before you go to sleep. Our editors noticed an 85% reduction in breakouts and 3x more even skin when they stuck to properly removing makeup on a daily basis.\n The right cleanser is key\nA good cleanser washes your skin without stripping your natural oils. You need these naturally occurring wonders to maintain skin suppleness and to give you that magic glow. We found the Korean two step cleansing method best because it\u0026rsquo;s gentle, yet thorough. For the first step, use an oil cleanser to remove any oil-based impurities such as makeup, SPF, sebum and any other impurities your skin has collected throughout the day. After rinsing the oil cleanser, you follow with a foam cleanser to remove any remaining impurities and complete the job. The Face Shop\u0026rsquo;s oil and foam cleanser duo is an excellent budget friendly option. If you prefer more traditional cleansers, please take a look at this list.\nExfoliate carefully\nOur skin naturally exfoliates dead cells, but with age and unprotected sun exposure, the natural exfoliation process slows and may stop entirely. This results in an uneven skin tone, dull, dry, or flaky skin; clogged, enlarged pores; bumps, wrinkles and a loss of firmness.\nHelping skin gently exfoliate reveals the beautiful, soft, hydrated skin hiding beneath.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tempting to choose a heavy duty, abrasive exfoliator to get fast results. However, take it easy! Harsh exfoliants will leave micro tears/scarring on your skin that will build up over time and in the long run, will make your skin appear more rough an uneven. Avoid those with crushed walnut shells or abrasive ingredients.\n A gentle, long term approach is much better. We prefer AHA (alpha hydroxy acids/glycolic and lactic acids) and BHA (beta hydroxy/salicylic acid) exfoliants to traditional face scrubs. AHAs and BHAs both act to “unglue” the bonds holding dull, dead skin on the surface. AHA is more gentle and superficial (better if you have dry skin), BHAs go deeper (better for oily skin, breakout prone skin). Beverly Hills 3 AHA Exfoliant uses three forms of alpha-hydroxy acids: Glycolic Acid, Pyruvic Acid and Lactic Acid. The formula provides a good amount of exfoliation in a nourishing and penetrating gel.Paula\u0026rsquo;s Choice BHA exfoliant put our breakouts to rest and even helped reduce scarring from old ones. Or you can get one that\u0026rsquo;s a combination for AHA/BHA if you have oily or combination skin. Our favourite is Murad\u0026rsquo;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating cleanser/.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s best to start with one application per week and work up to 2 (depending on the strength of the formula you choose and your skin\u0026rsquo;s response). When you start using facial exfoliants, always do a patch test under your jaw and wait a couple of days before doing a full application.\nTone, if you like\nToners are often misunderstood and many disagree on their effectiveness. They are said to remove excess dirt, traces of oil and makeup, correct and balance the pH of your skin, and helps control acne. We mainly look to our toner to balance/restore our skin\u0026rsquo;s PH after cleansing and we do notice that our skin is better with a toner. However, because the difference is not as pronounced as with the other products in our routine, it\u0026rsquo;s the first product we skip when in a rush. Just want to be entirely honest.\nOur original reluctance to toners comes from the late 90s and early 2000\u0026rsquo;s - when toners were harsh and often left \u0026ldquo;toned\u0026rdquo; with a sting. Since then, toners have come a long way and include a variety of ingredients that many people see as a boost to their routine. We however, recommend a gentle toner to avoid unnecessarily doubling up on ingredients found in your other products. Poppy Austin\u0026rsquo;s Rose Water Toner  is a dream come true. Our skin felt lovely, refreshed and ready for the next step after each application. We miss it the days we skip it.\n \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; Updated upstream To apply, we simple put a little bit on our hands and gently dab it our face. Do not rub it in (you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with uneven application) and do not use a cotton pad to apply - you will waste product.\n Serums and moisturisers\nWhich goes first? Do you need both? What about sunscreen?\nThe answer to the first question is apply in order of consistency — from thinnest to thickest. Serum is basically a treatment for existing skin problems or prevents you from/slows down future ones including dark spots, wrinkles, unevenness, etc. A basic guideline for ingredients is as follows:\n Vitamin C: brightens dull skin and decreases dark spots Hyaluronic acid: seals in moisture and prevents moisture loss Retinol, vitamin B3: stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, which help prevent lines and sagging Colloidal sulfur, niacinamide: calm redness by decreasing inflammation, and have antimicrobial effects to improve acne  Moisturises hydrate, soften and prevent water loss.\nThe optimal moisturiser depends on your skin type. The weight should counter balance your skin type. Heavier moisturisers are ideal for dry skin, light (gel-like) moisturisers suit oily skin and something in between the two suits combination skin. Choose a moisturiser with sunscreen of at least SPF 30 to save you the trouble of needing to apply sunscreen separately. Choose a broadband spectrum sunscreen to ensure that you get the most thorough type of sun protection possible. Sunscreen is not optional and is one of the most important parts of a skin care routine.\nApply your moisturiser a minute after your serum to give the serum a chance to absorb. Mixing your moisturiser with your serum is likely to deprive you of some of the benefits of your serum.\n If you hate the idea of using too many products, find a multi-function moisturiser that has some of the ingredients you\u0026rsquo;d need from a serum. It\u0026rsquo;s a less potent solution, but is often a good compromise for those who want minimal effort. Our favourite is Murad\u0026rsquo;s Anti-Aging Moisturiser  because it moisturises, protects and absorbs quickly. Guinot\u0026rsquo;s Hydra Finish Creme is fantastic as well because it enhances our complexion and has mallow extract to help calm redness.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget your eye cream\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; Updated upstream Eye creams are not an absolute necessity, but if you have particular concerns such as dark circles, crepey skin, eye bags, sagging, etc., eye creams do make a difference. Again, choosing the ingredients that offer solutions to your concerns is key.\n \nUnder eye bags and dark circles are the most common concerns. Wrinkles and droopiness are close second and third. The former result for a variety of reasons and it is imperative to outline the exact cause(s) to find your relevant cure(s). The latter is mostly a matter of aging and can be helped with the right treatment.\nBecause the skin around the eye area is so delicate, we recommend that you avoid heavy products. You don\u0026rsquo;t want anything pulling on or weighing down the already delicate and thinner tissue.\nA good all-around, weightless option isTatcha Luminous Deep Hydration Firming Eye Serum. It\u0026rsquo;s key ingredient - Okinawa red algae enhances the skin\u0026rsquo;s barrier function, replenishes natural water reservoir and increases its moisture-retention capabilities. Honeysuckle leaf and caffeine sooth and act as anti-oxidants. We saw visible firming, reduced puffiness, and plumping.\n","permalink":"https://lucylucy83.github.io/basic-skincare-routine/","tags":["Skincare","Face","Face Routine"],"title":"Basic Skincare Routine"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Contact MySkinin\nDo you have a skin care question?\nSend it to us!

Knowing how to get rid of chapped lips will help you stay more comfortable in this weather. We’ve tested many of the diy remedies and products available on the market to discover some of the key things that will get your lips back into shape fast, including two key factors. Keep reading.\nKnowing how to cure chapped lips fast is actually only half of the battle. Dry winter lips are only a symptom and it’s important to understand why do lips get dry. We will share all of this information with you so that you are well armed to tackle and even prevent the dryness, cracks and tightness on the lips that comes with cold weather.\nWhy do lips get dry?\n Your lips don’t have oil glands so they don’t naturally lubricate themselves like the majority of the rest of the skin on your body. They are also almost always exposed to the elements because they are not covered by clothing, hair, etc. Wind and cold, dry air that come with the winter months only make the exposure more damaging. However, the good news is that of all the skin on your body, your lips have one of the highest cell turnover rates. That means that when the skin on your lips does get dry, chapped, damaged, etc., it is among the fastest to recover. Therefore, our methods on how to get rid of dry winter lips should work quickly. However, the ultimate takeaway here is that you need to nourish, protect and replenish your lips.\nHow to get rid of dry lips fast\n To get rid of dry lips fast, you will need a greasy lip balm that sticks to your lips. Balms containing ingredients like petroleum jelly, coconut oil, beeswax, almond oil and vitamin E tend to work well. Avoid ingredients that can irritate sensitive skin such as: eucalyptus oil, camphor and menthol.\nIf possible, try to check the texture of the balm before purchasing it. If it disappears quickly, is runny and doesn’t have much stickiness to it, it won’t be enough to help with dry winter lips. Our favourite is Lanolips Original Ointment. It’s so moisturizing that even bleeding, cracked lips felt instantly soothed. It’s sticking power meant that we didn’t need to apply it to often. Weleda’s Skin Food Lip Butter not only provided intensive nourishment for our dry winter lips, but it also created a barrier to protect them from the elements until they healed properly.\n Consistency is key\n Because consistent application is one of the most important things when it comes to We recommend getting a couple of tubes of your favourite lip balm to keep with you all the time. Originally, we kept our lip balm in our handbag and would get too lazy to get it out to apply. We started keeping it in our pocket, but then that meant changing pockets and/or losing the balm altogether. So now we keep a couple around to ensure that we always have a layer of balm on our dry winter lips.\n Rescue Lip Scrub\nA lip scrub sloughs dry, dead skin of your lips, but it must be used with caution on dry winter lips.\nIf your lips are bleeding or cracked, do not use a lip scrub. Otherwise, we recommend a gentle scrub from non acidic ingredients. So you don’t want salt, sugar or any acidic scrub. For dry winter lips, use only a scrub where the scrub agents are made of natural ingredients such as walnuts, cornmeal, etc. The reason for this is that you want to gently encourage the dry, dead skin to come off your lips, but you don’t want to dry them or aggravate them further with acidic ingredients. We love Baxter’s Cornmeal and Walnut Scrub because it gently removed the dry, dead skin from our lips and did not aggravate them. While it’s intended to be used as a face scrub, we use it only as a lip scrub.\nOvernight lip mask\n Our bodies repair themselves more at night and our lips are no exception. So why not take advantage of this time when our bodies reparative powers are amplified and put an intensive mask on your lips before bed time? A couple of nights with a lip mask made a big difference for us.\nSome of our team still use butter on our dry lips before bedtime. But somehow, the taste of butter is less appealing and there are more powerful remedies out there. The best sleep mask we have found is an old classic by Laneige - Lip Berry Sleep Mask. It goes on quick thick, but when you wake up, you get more dewy, softer and less chapped lips. It also has a nice applicator, which is much more hygenic.\nAvoid at all costs\n As tempting as it may be to peel the drier skin off your lips, avoid it all costs. This will only perpetuate the cycle. Avoid touching your lips and avoid using a potted lip balm. Use one in a tube in a stick form. Potted lip balms, particularly the kind where you have to use your finger, accumulate dirt and bacteria very quickly. In fact, they become a breeding ground for it with skin cells, germs, etc.\n","permalink":"https://lucylucy83.github.io/dry-winter-lips/","tags":["Dry lips","chapped lips","winter lips"],"title":"Dry Lips In Winter?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://lucylucy83.github.io/search/","tags":null,"title":"Search Result"},{"categories":["Body"],"contents":"Finding the perfect skin care routine for your face is great, but a routine for skin care for your body is a must too. Just as you should use a facial cleanser, exfoliator, and moisturizer (and more) on your face, you should also use skin care products on the skin below your neck. Dry, itchy, aged skin on your body takes away from the glowing complexion you\u0026rsquo;ve worked so hard to achieve.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve been neglecting the skin on your body, it\u0026rsquo;s time to create a body skin care routine. A basic body skin care routine can be easy and fast. You just need a bit of organisation and the right tools.\n The key to a perfect body skin care routine is finding one that is easy enough for you to stick with, yet will go beyond what you are doing. Don\u0026rsquo;t add a million new steps and don\u0026rsquo;t create such a lengthy routine that you won\u0026rsquo;t have time for it. Simple, new and easy is key.\n   Step 1: Get clean\nThe first part of a good body skin care routine should be cleansing. Choose a body cleanser with enough power to remove dirt and grease, but not so much that it will strip your skin of natural oils and make it dry. We love CeraVe\u0026rsquo;s hydrating body wash because it cleans without attacking the skin barrier. If you prefer a body cleanser with scent, we love Fenjal\u0026rsquo;s Creme Body Wash. It\u0026rsquo;s classic and timeless Swiss formula that leaves your skin cleansed, soft and nourished. It also has a pleasant and not too heavy fragrance that lingers on your skin.\n Step 2: Exfoliate\nA body skin routing should involve exfoliation at least 1-2 times per week. Exfoliation helps remote dead skin cells, can improve circulation and reduce the appearance of cellulite. We recommend exfoliating with a body scrub, a body brush or an exfoliating glove. We find body scrubs to be the most thorough form of exfoliation. Body brushes have a better impact on the appearance of cellulite and exfoliating gloves tend to be the fastest since you just put them on your hands and scrub away.\n  Step 3: Shave\nScrubbing your skin regularly will make your shave even smoother and easier. Once you\u0026rsquo;re ready, either use your own, already proven method, or check out this shaving guide.\n Step 4: Dry Off\nDid you know that your post shower towel is another opportunity to exfoliate your skin? We love towels that have a bit more texture to give your skin a free exfoliation session. We recommend washing your towels frequently and giving them plenty of space to dry. Wet towels are prime breeding ground for bacteria and you want to give them little chance for survival. This one by Aquis offers texture and fast drying.\n Step 5: Moisturise\nHydration is key for soft, smooth skin. However, many people skip it because it\u0026rsquo;s a bit time consuming. We find that using a moisturing spray and leaving your skin just slightly damp post toweling off makes the job much faster and easier. Spray moisturiser saves your the time of having to pump of squeeze the moisturiser on to your body. It also saves you the need to spread it. With a spray, you can eliminate those two steps. Just spray the moisturiser all over and just rub it a bit. We find that this version from Neutrogena absorbs very quickly and easily.\n Scrubbing your skin regularly will make your shave even smoother and easier. Once you\u0026rsquo;re ready, either use your own, already proven method, or check out this shaving guide.\n","permalink":"https://lucylucy83.github.io/skincare-body/","tags":["Body scrub","Smooth skin","Body"],"title":"Skincare For Your Body"}]
